## 🔐 About Me
I'm deeply passionate about **cybersecurity** — especially in the **offensive** and **defensive** domains.  
This GitHub is where I share my **learning journey**, **hands-on labs**, and **projects** related to ethical hacking, penetration testing, and system hardening.

I believe that **sharing knowledge helps everyone grow**, so most of my repositories are designed to be **educational and reusable** — whether you're a student, a security researcher, or just curious about how things work under the hood.
